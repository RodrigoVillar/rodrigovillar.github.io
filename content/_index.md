# About Me

My name is Rodrigo and I am currently a 4th year student at Cornell University.
I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Outside my academic studies, I am deeply interested in the fields of blockchain
and distributed systems. My interests currently lie in virtual machines; having studied the implementation of the Ethereum Virtual
Machine and its applications (i.e. smart contracts) for some time, I now focus on alternative virtual
machine architectures. In the past, I've also focused on Maximal Extractable
Value (MEV) and the mathematics behind Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

In my free time, I enjoy taking my dog Lucho on walks and practicing Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu.

## Experience

### Developer Relations Intern - Ava Labs (July 2023 - November 2023)

Most of my internship revolved around building out Avalanche Academy. In
particular, I contributed heavily to both the [Customize the
EVM](https://academy.avax.network/course/customize-evm) course and the upcoming
_Introduction to Solidity Programming_ course.

Additionally, I rewrote the majority of the [Rust
documentation](https://academy.avax.network/course/customize-evm) on the
Avalanche documentation page and implemented a prototype of _ChessVM_ during my
time as an intern.

### Course Instructor - CS4998 [Blockchain Development] (January 2023 - December 2023)

I founded the first technical, for-credit blockchain course in the Ivy League. In
addition to creating original course content (homeworks, slides, etc.), I am
also in the process of writing a Solidity textbook to accompany the course for
future iterations.

### Capital Markets Intern - Crosstower

I automated the process of risk report generations at the end of each trading
day for the trading desk. Additionally, I queried on-chain data to produce
visual graphs for the traders to identify correlations.
